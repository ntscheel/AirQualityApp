            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>
                Breath of Fresh Air is a project designed for the Web Development course at the University of St. Thomas taught by Dr. Tommy Marrinan. For this project, our goal was to create an air quality web app that combines the visualization of Google Maps with the data provided by the OpenAQ Platform.
            </p>
            <h3>Google Maps API</h3>
            <p>
                The <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a> is the backbone of the Breath of Fresh Air project, powering the main functionality and allowing us to serve relevant air quality data for the location shown in the map. To further increase the usability of the map, we used a feature called Marker Clustering to reduce cluttering on screen. Speaking of the markers, try clicking on one! It will show the measurement gathered at that location.
            </p>
            <h3>OpenAQ</h3>
            <p>
                While Google Maps is the technological centerpiece of this project, <a target="_blank" href="https://openaq.org">OpenAQ</a> is the information one. Gathering air quality measurments from 8,415 location in 64 countries, OpenAQ is fighting to increase awareness and reduce air pollution by aggregating data from 103 different government level and research grade sources and providing a free API to access this data. to learn more information about OpenAQ, we recommend visiting their <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/openaq/openaq-info/blob/master/FAQ.md">FAQ</a>.

            <h3>Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
                This site was created using both <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. Bootstrap was used to format the page correctly using their grid system to section the page and prvice some default CSS styling. Angular was used for its templating and table creation. The font used is Called <a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a>, which is from Google Fonts.
